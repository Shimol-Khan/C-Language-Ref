/* C Program Structure
    A C program involves the following sections:
        * Documentations (Documentation Section)
        * Preprocessor Statements (Link Section)
        * Global Declarations (Definition Section)
        * The main() function
        * Local Declarations
        * Program Statements & Expressions
        * User Defined Functions

        All C programs must have a main() which contains two parts:
            * Declaration part
            * Execution part
 */

// Sample Program

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n"); // Hello, World!
    return 0;
}
